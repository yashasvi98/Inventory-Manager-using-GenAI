# Test Directory

This directory contains unit and integration tests for the Inventory Manager project.

- Unit tests: Test individual classes (controllers, services, mappers, DTOs, entities, repositories).
- Integration tests: Test the interaction between multiple components and the API endpoints.

All new test classes should be placed in the appropriate package structure here (e.g., `controller`, `service`, `repository`, etc.).
